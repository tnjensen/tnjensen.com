          <p>I'm a clarinettist in the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra & Opera. Our concert venue is Olavshallen. Thanks to our collaboration with the Trondheim Soloists the orchestra has 90 members for most of our productions.</p>

          <p>In recent years, TSO has put on at least one major opera-production every year. From the 2016-17 season we also have the TSO Vocal Ensemble in place, participating in the opera productions, and also giving their own concerts.</p>

          <p>Once every year we invite our audience to an Open Day for the whole family.
            The children can listen to small ensembles, try out different instruments, write their own music, and even conduct a small ensemble.
            Finally, everyone is invited to a family-concert with the full orchestra.</p>
